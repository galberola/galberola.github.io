Hi 👋 My name is Gustavo.

I worked as a Software Developer for around 15 years. I loved my job, but I always wanted to become a Game Developer on the first place. But I deemed too risky.


Well... No more... With my trustworthy companion Naru 🐹 (my pet Cobayo) we decided to embark on this new journey of **becoming an Independent Game Developer 👾**
